# Yoga-API_Capstone

My Thinkful Yoga API Capstone Project allows users to learn about some of the most common yoga poses.

## Usage

Users will choose a yoga pose from the dropdown menu on the main page and once "enter" is clicked, the user will see the name of the yoga pose in its original Sanskrit language, along with an illustration of what the pose should look like and a video on how-to do that pose
