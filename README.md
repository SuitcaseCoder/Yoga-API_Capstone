## Motivation

As a runner, yoga seemed too slow-paced, boring, and difficult-to-follow, however, I knew yoga is well-known for its many health benefits... especially for runners! Walking into a yoga studio for the first time can be very intimidating and may seem impossible... 'there's no way, I'll be able to literally bend over backward with my arms twisted like that... and what's it called? ...' That was the constant inner dialogue that ran through my mind during my first few yoga classes.

## Summary

Now, with the use of my app, any user can become familiar with the poses by visualizing the pose with its sanskrit name AND a how-to video! No more "namastay -in -bed" for me or you!

## Usage

The user can read a quick explanation of the app on the landing page. The user will then choose a yoga pose from the dropdown menu and once a selection has been made and "enter" is clicked, the user will see the name of the yoga pose in its original Sanskrit language at the top of the page, followed by a simple illustration of the pose and a how-to video for that pose.

## How it was built

Grit (my own personal grit, that is)
